Since October 2019, I am a PhD student at [AIRBUS](https://www.airbus.com/) in the hardware/software qualification team and at [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/) in the [ARGOS team](https://www.irit.fr/departement/fiabilite-des-systemes-et-des-logiciels/equipe-argos/). I work under the supervision of [Ileana Ober](https://www.irit.fr/~Ileana.Ober/Home.html) and [Iulian Ober](https://www.irit.fr/~Iulian.Ober/) from IRIT and Christophe Gabreau from AIRBUS.  
The subject of my PhD is **Certifiability of embedded systems based on machine learning software**.
